ISSUES TO WORK ON
1. SHARED PREFERENCES WON'T CLEAR. COLLECTION LIST IS STILL FULL REGARDLESS
OF PUTTING IN EDITOR.CLEAR
    a. fixed the issue with clearing. 5/1

2. THE KEY VALUE PAIR FROM MAPPING SHOWS THE TITLE OF THE GAME THEN THE
STRING 'TITLE' FROM THE toString() METHOD. EVERYTHING ELSE IS FINE
    a. fixed issue. had to remove the 'key' from the map in CollectionListAct 5/1

3. THE IMAGE VIEW WILL NOT SHOW VISIBLY IF YOU SET IT TO VISIBLE. I HAVE IT SET TO INVISIBLE
FOR NOW. IT SHOULD SHOW THE CORRESPONDING IMAGE BASED OFF WHAT IS SELECTED FROM THE SWITCHES
